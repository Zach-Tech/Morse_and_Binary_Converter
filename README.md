# Morse and Binary Converter
## This application converts a string to Morse code and will allow the user to play back the audio. Additionaly, the user may translate a string to binary - there is no auditory signal for this.

### The Audio - Alphabet for the morse code is in-fact "real" conversion, and not simply a console beep. These files are provided via .wav

### A clock is also provided, assets found on StackOverflow.
